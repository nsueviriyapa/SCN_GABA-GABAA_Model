# SCN_GABA-GABAA_Model

UPDATEs in progress*  

*Note: This repository will contain MATLAB codes written for the networked SCN oscillator model with the detailed GABAergic mechanisms and related signaling pathways at synaptic and extra-synaptic regions. The codes will be made publicly accessible once the research work has been submitted for review by the journal and officially accepted for publication.
